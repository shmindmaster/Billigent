# Billigent Data Lake - Stakeholder Access Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The Billigent Data Lake has been successfully organized and optimized for stakeholder review. We've implemented a clean medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) and enabled public access to appropriate data layers.

## 📊 Data Lake Structure

### Current Organization

## 🔓 Public Access URLs for Stakeholder Review

### Silver Layer - FHIR Healthcare Data

**Direct Access:** https://billigentdevdlseus2.blob.core.windows.net/data/silver/fhir/

**Sample Files:**

- Condition Records: https://billigentdevdlseus2.blob.core.windows.net/data/silver/fhir/Condition/
- Observation Records: https://billigentdevdlseus2.blob.core.windows.net/data/silver/fhir/Observation/

### Gold Layer - Business Analytics (Ready for Demo)

**Direct Access:** https://billigentdevdlseus2.blob.core.windows.net/data/gold/

**Available Directories:**

- Analytics: https://billigentdevdlseus2.blob.core.windows.net/data/gold/analytics/
- CDI Models: https://billigentdevdlseus2.blob.core.windows.net/data/gold/cdi-models/
- Denial Patterns: https://billigentdevdlseus2.blob.core.windows.net/data/gold/denial-patterns/

## 🎭 Problems Solved

### ✅ Eliminated Confusion

- **Before:** Two "bronze" locations (bronze container + data/bronze folder)
- **After:** Single, clear medallion architecture in data container

### ✅ Organized by Domain

- **Before:** Mixed data types in single locations
- **After:** Clear separation by data domain (terminologies, claims, clinical, ml-datasets)

### ✅ Enabled Stakeholder Access

- **Before:** No public access for stakeholder review
- **After:** Public read access to Silver and Gold layers

### ✅ Future-Proofed Architecture

- **Before:** Ad-hoc data storage
- **After:** Industry-standard medallion architecture supporting data governance

## 🔐 Security & Access Levels

| Layer      | Access Level     | Purpose             | Stakeholder Access       |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Bronze** | Internal Only    | Raw healthcare data | ❌ No (HIPAA sensitive)  |
| **Silver** | Stakeholder Read | Validated FHIR data | ✅ Yes (review purposes) |
| **Gold**   | Public Demo      | Business analytics  | ✅ Yes (demo ready)      |

## 📋 Next Steps for Stakeholders

### 1. Data Review Tasks

- [ ] Review Silver layer FHIR data structure and quality
- [ ] Validate Gold layer analytics readiness for demos
- [ ] Confirm data domains align with business requirements
- [ ] Test public URL accessibility

### 2. Business Validation

- [ ] Verify CDI models directory structure meets requirements
- [ ] Confirm denial patterns data organization
- [ ] Validate analytics data structure for dashboard development

### 3. Technical Validation

- [ ] Test FHIR data compatibility with existing systems
- [ ] Validate terminologies data completeness
- [ ] Confirm claims data format and structure
