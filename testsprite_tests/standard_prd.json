    "Clinical Documentation Improvement specialists receive prioritized cases in the pre-bill CDI review queue based on financial and clinical impact scores.",
    "Users upload denial letters (PDF) which are processed asynchronously with AI-driven analysis extracting denial reasons and classifying root causes.",
    "Specialists review AI-generated appeal drafts assisted by the conversational AI copilot and submit these for appeals processing.",
    "Managers track appeal statuses, monitor team performance, and drill down into KPI visualizations with interactive charts and natural language queries.",
    "System administrators monitor application health, audit logs, and security compliance dashboards ensuring HIPAA adherence and system integrity."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "System accurately ingests denial events and computes denial rates with root cause classifications matching Change Healthcare taxonomy with >95% accuracy.",
    "Dashboard KPIs refresh within 24 hours and UI responses for queries complete within 2 seconds at 95th percentile under target loads.",
    "Physician query UI enforces non-leading template compliance with immutable audit and unique query identifiers per HIPAA ยง164.312 requirements.",
    "Automated appeal letters generated by AI cite regulatory sources and clinical evidence with traceable provenance and pass human expert validation workflows.",
    "Pre-bill cases are prioritized correctly reflecting calculated financial impact and risk stratification with user feedback confirming prioritization relevance.",
    "Denial letter PDF upload and OCR processing achieve >95% extraction accuracy of CARC/RARC codes and denial reasons.",
    "System maintains 99.9% uptime SLA supporting 1,000 concurrent users without degradation.",
    "Multi-factor authentication and role-based access controls are enforced for all users, with audit logs capturing all data access meeting HIPAA security mandates.",
