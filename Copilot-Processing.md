# Copilot Processing - CDI Solution Development

## User Request

"Do it man .. based on your knowledge and best for what we are trying to build an ai powered CDI solution"

**Context**: User wants me to proceed with completing the comprehensive type and lint error resolution across the entire Billigent project, using my expertise to make the best architectural decisions for building an AI-powered Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI) solution.

## Current Analysis (96 Backend Errors)

**Root Cause**: Schema and code are misaligned. Key issues:

- Code uses plural (cases, denials) but schema is singular (case, denial)
- Missing fields: denialId, potentialFinancialImpact, activityType, appealLetterDraft, etc.
- Type mismatches in JSON fields (recommendations, riskFactors)

**CDI Solution Strategy**: Fix model naming first, then enhance schema for clinical workflows
