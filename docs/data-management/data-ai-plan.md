# **Billigent Data & AI Strategy Plan**

**Version:** 2.1  
**Date:** August 10, 2025  
**Status:** Active Implementation  
**Owner:** Data & AI Team

## **1. Executive Summary**

This document outlines the comprehensive data and AI strategy for the Billigent clinical intelligence platform. Our approach is to build an authoritative, defensible, and highly accurate AI system by creating a production-grade **Azure Data Lakehouse**.

Our strategy is founded on the ingestion of over **31 authoritative datasets** from official sources like CMS, CDC, and X12, combined with HIPAA-safe synthetic patient data from sources like Synthea. This robust data foundation powers our Azure OpenAI models to deliver real-time pre-bill audits, automate ICD-10 code validation, and optimize denial appeals. This plan ensures our platform is built on a compliant, scalable, and intelligent architecture designed to deliver a significant reduction in denials and a measurable improvement in revenue capture.

## **2. Data Architecture Strategy**

### **2.1 Data Lakehouse Architecture (Bronze-Silver-Gold)**

#### **Bronze Layer: Raw Data Ingestion**

- **Purpose**: The immutable landing zone for all raw, untransformed data from all external sources.
- **Storage**: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (`billigentdevdlseus2`)
- **Structure**:
  ```
  /bronze/
  ├── fhir/             # Raw FHIR bundles (e.g., from Synthea)
  ├── terminologies/    # Raw rulebooks (ICD-10, MS-DRG, NCCI, CARC/RARC)
  ├── notes/            # Unstructured clinical notes (e.g., from MIMIC-IV)
  ├── claims/           # Payer/claims data (e.g., from CMS LDS)
  └── huggingface/      # AI augmentation datasets
  ```

#### **Silver Layer: Cleaned & Standardized Data**

- **Purpose**: Data from the bronze layer is cleaned, validated, de-duplicated, and normalized into queryable formats (Parquet). This is the source for application queries and AI feature engineering.
- **Processing**: Azure Data Factory & Azure Functions

#### **Gold Layer: Business-Ready Analytics**

- **Purpose**: Highly aggregated and curated data marts optimized for business intelligence, executive dashboards, and training production ML models.
- **Processing**: Azure Synapse Analytics

### **2.2 Data Ingestion Strategy**

The core of our strategy is to ingest over 31 authoritative and supplementary datasets.

- **Authoritative Sources:** Our primary sources are official U.S. regulatory bodies to ensure our AI's logic is grounded in truth:
  - **CMS.gov**: For HCPCS, ICD-10-PCS, MS-DRG definitions, and NCCI edits.
  - **X12.org**: For official CARC & RARC denial and adjustment code sets.
  - **NLM/CDC**: For ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes.
  - **ONC**: For interoperability and clinical vocabulary standards.
- **Synthetic & Supplementary Sources:** For realistic workflows and advanced training without PHI exposure:
  - **Synthea**: For FHIR R4 compliant synthetic patients, claims, and encounters.
  - **MIMIC-IV**: For rich, de-identified clinical notes for NLP training.
  - **Hugging Face**: For specialized, instruction-tuned datasets for RAG.

_Why this matters:_ This multi-source approach creates AI-ready datasets that power **ICD-10 miscoding detection, predictive denial prevention, and fact-based compliance checks**. It enables **real-time pre-bill audits (\<2s)** while staying fully aligned with Medicare and payer rules.

### **2.3 Data Governance Framework**

- **Data Quality Management**: We will implement automated validation rules at each stage (bronze-to-silver, silver-to-gold), including FHIR schema validation, business rule checks, and referential integrity constraints. Azure Monitor will provide real-time alerting on data quality issues.
- **Data Lineage & Catalog**: Azure Purview will be used to automatically scan and catalog our data sources, providing end-to-end data flow documentation and a self-service data discovery portal.
- **Privacy & Security**: PHI will be de-identified at the earliest possible stage using Azure Text Analytics for Health. All access is governed by strict Azure RBAC roles.

## **3. AI/ML Strategy**

### **3.1 Azure OpenAI Integration**

- **Primary Model**: **`gpt-5-mini`** via the stateful Azure OpenAI **Responses API**.
- **Use Cases**: Clinical documentation analysis, coding recommendation, appeal letter creation, and natural language query processing.
- **Cost Optimization**: We will implement intelligent caching for common requests and context compression techniques to manage token usage efficiently.

### **3.2 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

- **Knowledge Base Architecture**: Azure AI Search will host our vector indices. The knowledge sources will be the authoritative terminologies (ICD-10, MS-DRG, NCCI) and supplementary datasets (MIMIC-IV, Hugging Face).
- **Embedding Model**: `text-embedding-ada-002` will be used to generate 1536-dimension vectors.
- **RAG Pipeline**:
  1.  A query or clinical document is received.
  2.  The RAG service queries Azure AI Search to retrieve the most relevant rules, codes, and clinical examples.
  3.  This retrieved context is passed to `gpt-5-mini` along with the original request.
  4.  The model generates a response that is **grounded** in the retrieved, authoritative data, with citations.

### **3.3 Custom Machine Learning Models**

- **Documentation Quality Scoring Model**: An XGBoost model to assess documentation completeness and predict quality scores with \>85% precision.
- **Denial Risk Prediction Model**: A Gradient Boosting model to predict the likelihood of a claim denial before submission with \>80% recall for high-risk claims.
- **Appeal Success Optimization Model**: A multi-class classification model to recommend optimal appeal strategies based on denial reason and payer patterns.

### **3.4 MLOps & Model Lifecycle Management**

- **Version Control**: DVC for data and model versioning.
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow integrated with Azure Machine Learning.
- **Deployment**: Models will be containerized and served via Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Instances.
- **Monitoring**: We will implement automated model drift detection with alerts configured in Azure Monitor. Retraining will be triggered by performance degradation metrics.

### **3.5 AI Safety, Ethics & Human-in-the-Loop**

- **Bias Detection & Mitigation**: We will conduct regular fairness audits on all models across demographic and clinical lines, using diverse training data to mitigate bias.
- **Explainability (XAI)**: All AI recommendations will be accompanied by clear reasoning and citations (SHAP values for ML models, source citations for RAG).
- **Human-in-the-Loop Design**: All critical, high-impact AI outputs (e.g., coding changes, appeal submissions) will require mandatory validation by a human expert. AI recommendations below a 90% confidence threshold will be automatically flagged for human review.
