# Stakeholder Summary – Strategy Stream A3 (v0.1)
**Date:** 2025-08-14  
**Audience:** Exec, Product, Engineering, Clinical Advisory  
**Source Artifacts:** `strategy-stream-a3.md`, `competitive-analysis.md`, A3 specs.

## 1. Why Now
Fragmented vendor coverage leaves high-severity needs (front-end root causes, avoidable denials, denial rework cost) partially served; zero automation in appeals + universally low explainability → opportunity for integrated, evidence-grounded loop.

## 2. Strategic Pillars
| Pillar | Value Proposition | Market Gap |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| Appeals Automation Engine | Compress cycle time & increase overturn odds with citation-rich drafts | All evaluated vendors = none |
| Explainability & Trust Layer | Elevate acceptance & compliance with span-level traceability | Uniformly low transparency |
| Unified Prevention→Documentation→Appeal Loop | Close feedback loop to prevent recurrence & uplift specificity | Capabilities siloed across incumbents |
| KPI-to-Action Orchestration | Turn passive dashboards into prioritized remediation queues | KPI leverage minimal (1/9 vendors) |
| Predictive Specificity Uplift | Drive CMI & code accuracy via explainable recommendations | No predictive uplift modeling depth |

## 3. Weighted Whitespace (Illustrative)
Need scores (severity * (1 - coverage)): front_end_root_causes 3.90; avoidable_nonrecoverable_denials 3.90; initial_denial_pressure 3.35; denial_rework_cost 3.12; kpi_visibility 2.67.

## 4. Differentiation Thesis
Proprietary Evidence Graph + explainable automation unifies denial prevention signals, CDI uplift, and appeals generation—compelling ROI + defensible moat (data network + audit-grade provenance + adaptive rules).

## 5. Phase 0 Deliverables (Current Sprint)
- Evidence graph schema draft (v0.1)
- Appeals drafting engine spec (v0.1)
- Explainability attribution schema (v0.1)
- KPI Rules DSL outline (v0.1)
- Instrumentation spec (v0.1)
- Competitive matrix + market need coverage

## 6. Next 4–6 Week Milestones
| Week | Target | Exit Criteria |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Evidence bundle & citation POC | JSON bundle + sample drafted section with span map |
| 2 | Rules DSL parser & evaluator MVP | Parse + fire rule against synthetic KPI snapshot |
| 3 | Appeals drafting minimal pipeline | Draft packet with header, summary, clinical evidence |
| 4 | Explainability validator + UI prototype | Render spans with confidence + gaps |
| 5 | Instrumentation pipeline (events → warehouse) | 90% schema adherence, dashboards seeded |
| 6 | Integrated loop demo | Denial pattern → rule fire → query generate + appeal draft |

## 7. Key Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data access latency | Slows evidence graph utility | Parallel ingestion tracks + mock harness |
| Model hallucination | Compliance/audit exposure | Strict retrieval gating + gap flags |
| Complexity creep | Delivery risk | Scope guardrails & milestone acceptance tests |

## 8. Decision Requests (Needed)
- Confirm ClinicalFact granularity (sentence vs span-level) for initial build.
- Approve inclusion of KPI impact section in default appeal packet.
- Endorse 6-week milestone sequencing.

## 9. Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. Finalize ClinicalFact granularity decision.  
2. Implement evidence bundle builder POC.  
3. Draft parser for DSL grammar (subset).  
4. Produce sample appeal JSON output (anonymized).  
5. Set up event schema registry & topics.  

## 10. Ask / Support
- Clinical advisory input on specificity uplift heuristics.
- Data engineering resourcing for KPI ingestion pipelines.
- Security review of citation/audit hash chaining approach.
