# Copilot Processing

## User Request Details (Continuation Context)
- Date: 2025-08-14
- Latest explicit user command: "continue"
- Interpreted meaning: Proceed with previously enumerated pending tasks in strategic documentation & prototype build workflow (extend PRD with RICE/backlog/roadmap, introduce Quality Gates, create structured competitive feature extraction JSON, citation density normalization, quantitative benchmarks, RICE scoring & backlog population, corpus enrichment, optional DSL evolution spec).

## Pending Objectives Snapshot
1. PRD augmentation: RICE prioritization, backlog (Epics -> Stories with IDs), roadmap alignment wave mapping.
2. Quality Gates definition (release readiness: data, model, explainability, security, a11y, performance) â€“ decide doc placement (extend `data-ai-plan.md` or new `quality-gates.md`).
3. Structured extraction artifact: `competitive_features.json` capturing competitor -> feature -> status (enum), evidence source citation references.
4. Citation density normalization: ensure every material claim/table row across docs has footnote or source tag.
5. Quantitative benchmarks research placeholders: pricing tiers ranges, adoption metrics, appeal overturn baseline, time-to-draft benchmarks.
6. RICE scoring execution for backlog items with Confidence referencing evidence corpus density and source diversity.
7. Corpus enrichment pass: add newly required quantitative sources into `corpus.jsonl` with metadata (source_type, reliability_score).
8. Optional: DSL evolution specification for KPI rules (future grammar: boolean combinations, temporal qualifiers, aggregation windows).

## Assumptions Captured
- No conflicting user directives supersede continuation.
- Strategy prototype code stable; focus shifts to documentation & structured data artifacts.
- Tooling available: file write operations only (no execution needed for docs).

## Constraints
- Maintain evidence-first methodology: every new claim linked to a source stub (even if TBD placeholder until enrichment).
- Maintain CHANGELOG entry per discrete artifact addition or major update.
- Follow accessibility guidance and secure coding (where code-like examples appear) minimally.

## Success Criteria (Initial)
- PRD updated with RICE & backlog sections referencing evidence IDs.
- Quality Gates documented with measurable thresholds.
- `competitive_features.json` created with schema + at least initial feature mapping for existing competitors from `competitive-analysis.md`.
- CHANGELOG updated for each artifact.
- No orphan claims (temporary TBD placeholders clearly marked and tagged for follow-up).

## Action Plan Phases

### Phase A: PRD Augmentation
Tasks:
- Insert RICE methodology overview section.
- Build Backlog table: ID, Epic, User Story (EARS), RICE inputs (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort), preliminary scores placeholders.
- Draft initial RICE values (or placeholders) referencing evidence citation IDs.
- Add Roadmap alignment tying top RICE items to Waves (Q1/Q2 etc.).

### Phase B: Quality Gates
Tasks:
- Decide placement (append to `data-ai-plan.md`).
- Define gate categories: Data, Model, Explainability, Security/Privacy, Accessibility, Performance, Observability.
- For each: measurable criteria, metric, threshold, evidence link.

### Phase C: Structured Competitive Features Extraction
Tasks:
- Define JSON schema (competitors[], features[], matrix entries with status enum: {native, partial, roadmap, absent, ambiguous}).
- Populate with current qualitative assessment from `competitive-analysis.md`.
- Add citation references (source_ids array) per competitor-feature tuple.

### Phase D: Citation Density Normalization
Tasks:
- Scan new/backlog sections; ensure each claim references an existing or placeholder source ID.
- Mark TBD sources for later enrichment.

### Phase E: Quantitative Benchmarks Placeholders
Tasks:
- Add sections listing required metrics & placeholder ranges (pricing, adoption, appeal overturn rate, drafting time) with TODO citations.

### Phase F: RICE Scoring Finalization
Tasks:
- Compute RICE Score = (Reach * Impact * Confidence) / Effort for backlog entries once placeholders replaced.
- Add rationale notes column referencing evidence density (count of sources backing each factor).

### Phase G: Corpus Enrichment Stubs
Tasks:
- For each placeholder metric, append stub entries to `corpus.jsonl` with status:"pending_collection".

### Phase H: Optional DSL Evolution Spec
Tasks:
- Sketch future grammar features & migration implications (deferred unless time remains).
