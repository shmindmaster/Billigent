# Copilot Processing - Backend API Implementation

## User Request Details

**Objective:** Build out the complete backend API for the Billigent platform. Transform the scaffolded backend into a working service with all necessary dependencies, Express server configuration, and complete API endpoints with robust business logic using Prisma Client.

## Current Analysis

- Previous session achieved zero TypeScript errors and production-ready foundation
- Current focus: Build comprehensive backend API implementation
- User has made manual edits to multiple backend files that need to be considered

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Install Missing Dependencies ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Add cors, dotenv, winston, zod to backend package
- [x] Add @types/cors as dev dependency
- [x] Verify installation and package.json updates
- **Status**: Dependencies successfully installed

### Phase 2: Implement Core Express Server ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Replace apps/backend/src/index.ts with production-ready server
- [x] Add CORS and JSON parsing middleware
- [x] Set up API routes structure with proper imports
- [x] Implement global error handler for resilience
- [x] Add health check endpoint for monitoring
- **Status**: User has already implemented sophisticated server with graceful shutdown, proper middleware, and comprehensive route structure

### Phase 3: Implement API Endpoints � IN PROGRESS

- [x] ~~Create prisma.service.ts for database access~~ (Prisma client imported directly in routes)
- [x] ~~Create apps/backend/src/routes/users.routes.ts~~ (Already exists as users.ts)
- [x] ~~Create apps/backend/src/routes/cases.routes.ts~~ (Already exists as cases.ts)
- [x] ~~Implement users GET endpoint for UI dropdowns~~ (Fully implemented with CRUD)
- [x] ~~Implement cases GET endpoint with filtering and pagination~~ (Advanced implementation with search)
- [x] ~~Implement case detail GET endpoint with unified data retrieval~~ (Comprehensive with includes)
- [x] ~~Implement queries POST endpoint for physician query workflows~~ (Already implemented in cases route)
- [ ] Create centralized prisma.service.ts for consistency
- [ ] Verify all existing routes compile correctly
- **Status**: User has already implemented comprehensive API with advanced features beyond the original plan including conversational AI and bulk operations

## Dependencies Met

- ✅ Enhanced Prisma schema with CDI-specific fields (completed in previous session)
- ✅ Database package with proper TypeScript configuration (completed)
- ✅ Zero compilation errors foundation (completed)
- ✅ Working CI/CD and build processes (completed)
