## 4️⃣ Critical Issues and Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required:
1. **Performance Investigation**: All tests are timing out after 15 minutes, indicating severe performance issues
2. **Backend Connectivity**: The frontend is showing API connection errors, suggesting backend services are not running
3. **Authentication Flow**: OAuth 2.0 integration with Microsoft Entra ID needs immediate attention
4. **System Responsiveness**: UI components are not responding within acceptable timeframes

### Technical Recommendations:
1. **Start Backend Services**: Ensure all backend APIs are running and accessible
2. **Performance Optimization**: Investigate and resolve timeout issues across all major components
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms
4. **Monitoring**: Set up real-time performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks

### Next Steps:
1. Verify backend service status and connectivity
2. Run performance profiling to identify timeout causes
3. Implement proper error handling and loading states
4. Re-run Testsprite tests after resolving critical issues
